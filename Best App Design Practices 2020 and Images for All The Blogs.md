# Best App Design Practices 2020

------------
### Optimal mobile app design is a design that does not require users to think much and focuses on emotions, motivations, and needs.
### Why You Should Care: The Importance of Mobile App Design In 2020

#### Nowadays, everyone is looking for valuable information, so it's become much harder to create attention-grabbing products. Though your product may be valuable, if it is difficult to use, nobody will waste time on finding app flow. Modern design should reflect the latest tech innovations.

### Best Practices in Mobile App Design in 2020

#### 1. Animations and Microinteractions
Using micro-interaction you are enabling the user to get interact with the app. It grabs the attention directly and we don't need to add an extra text or anything.
#### 2. 3D objects
3d objects allow the user to get a more realistic experience which will create interest in your product. When users view and touch a product it creates emotion and interest in conversion.
#### 3. New Skeuomorphism
Besides the 3d model or object, these style elements also create an effect like real-world objects. Which is now known as neumorphism. Details, shade & light create an effect that the user fill as realistic.

#### 4. Storytelling
Storytelling is all about providing flow which has less user interaction and clear thoughts for the user. It is a combination of short texts, informative illustrations, and an uninterrupted UI.

Here's how you can achieve it:

• Use short notifications on the page instead of pop-ups and overlays

• Use dynamic UI

#### 5. VR and AR
VR and AR are now coming in all industries apps that were used only in gaming & entertainment apps. It will stand out your app among others.

#### 6. Minimalism
This is my favorite one in which use of space and provides breath to elements. The average attention of humans with apps decreasing and it will continue to decrease so it's difficult to get the attention of the user, That is why minimalism and simplicity are two UX/UI trends that won't go away.

Here are some examples by which you can achieve minimalism:

• White space

• Hidden navigation panels and bars

• Enough margin & padding around element

A popular example of a buttonless solution is a liquid swipe, which provides a fully intuitive transition between pages and categories.

#### 7. Dark Mode
The Dark mode is very important nowadays to take care of your eyes. As you can see every app is coming in the dark mode which shows that people like black & eye-friendly interface to get interact.

### Let’s outline other visual elements that will grow in popularity in 2020:
#### 1) Gradients
Gradients haven’t lost ground for years. In 2020, it’ll be trendy to use soft shades, smooth transitions and more variable colors. Designers often use 2 or 4 main colors and their hues.
#### 2) Translucency
Translucent colors saturate elements with lightness and allow you to single out different visual blocks without any additional load.
#### 3) Rounded forms
Organic, soft, and asymmetric lines evoke feelings of comfort and safety. They’re especially beneficial in products that people associate with stress (such as finance, e-commerce, real estate, and construction).
#### 4) Bright neon colors
Futuristic shades of purple, pink, blue and green add the thrill of progress and novelty to the product.

### Conclusion
#### So the conclusion is today’s mobile app design trends are all about providing the best user-oriented solution in terms of user need with trending designs & technology. Make your design strategy by place your customer in focus to build trust and confidence in your product.
