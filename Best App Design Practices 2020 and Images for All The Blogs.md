### Optimal mobile app design is design that does not require users to think much and focuses on emotions, motivations, and needs.Why You Should Care: The Importance of Mobile App Design In 2020

##### Nowadays, everyone is looking for valuable information, so it's become much harder to create attention-grabbing products. Though, your product may be valuable, but if it is difficult to use, nobody will waste time on to find app flow. Modern design should reflect the latest tech innovations.

###Best Practices in Mobile App Design in 2020

#### 1. Animations and Microinteractions
Using micro interaction you are enabling user to get interact with app. It grab the attention directly and we don't need to add a extra text or anything
#### 2. 3D objects
3d objects allows user to get more realistic experience which will create interest in your product. When user view and touch product it creates emotion and interest in conversion
#### 3. New Skeumorphism
Besides the 3d model or object this style elements also create effect like real world objects. Which is now known as neumorphism.
Details, shade & light create effect which user fill like realistic.

#### 4. Storytelling
Storytelling is all about providing flow which has less user interaction and clear thoughts for user. It is the combination of short texts, informative illustrations, and an uninterrupted UI.
Here's how you can achieve it:

• Use short notifications on the page instead of pop-ups and overlays

• Use dynamic UI

#### 5. VR and AR
VR and AR is now coming in all industries apps which were use only in gaming & entertainment apps. It will stand out your app among others.

#### 6. Minimalism
This is my favorite one use space and provide breath to elements. Average attention of humans with apps decreasing and it will continue to decrease so it's difficult to get attention of user, That is why minimalism and simplicity are two UX/UI trends that won't go away.
Here is the some examples by you can achieve minimalism:
• White space
• Hidden navigation panels and bars
The popular example of a buttonless solution is a liquid swipe, which provides a fully intuitive transition between pages and categories.

#### 7. Dark Mode
Dark mode is very important now days to take care of your eyes. As you can see every app is coming in dark mode which shows that people like black & eye friendly interface to get interact.
