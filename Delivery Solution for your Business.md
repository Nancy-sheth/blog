On- Demand idea that came in year 2019 with taxi-booking app called UBER is now taking almost every industry storm. May it be retail, parcel services or restaurants, the organizations that are working on Uber-Like models are changing their standards by using this technology.

That's why Delivery solutions are necessary for the business to scale up their operations and increase profitability.

If you want to be competitive, you need to be able to deliver — literally, because more and more purchases are happening online.
- People will need their products as early as possible: For example if Snap Deal will provide delivery in 5 days and same thing Flipkart provides in 1 day so people will choose fastest delivery solutions even if they have to give extra Shipping charges. So always keep your delivery fast as you can.
- Buyers want everything from food to cleaning products delivered to their doors, and they will pay extra if you can get their order to them fast enough.
They are willing to pay more for the same day delivery.
- If you don’t have a good delivery plan in place, you won’t be able to exceed or even meet the expectations of your customers, and you could lose them — permanently.

These strategies can help one for a better delivery solution whethers its small-scale business for retailers or well- established market segment.
