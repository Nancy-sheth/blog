## 3. Lighthouse

Lighthouse is an open source, automated tool created by Google used to test the quality of web pages, specifically (but not strictly) for Progressive Web Apps. Lighthouse tests have audits built into them that grade web pages against performance, accessibility, best practices, search engine optimization, and Progressive Web Apps.

- Metrics used to analyse a Website

  Google Lighthouse gives a breakdown of your site into the accompanying metrics:

 - Performance
 - Accessibility
 - Best Practices
 - Progressive Web Applications

  **A) Performance**

    Performance is generally viewed as the most valuable metric given by the Google Lighthouse tool.

 Like the PageSpeed Insights, the Performance area of the Lighthouse report contains a few helpful metrics you can use to advance your site to climb Google's rankings.

 The Performance segment of the Lighthouse report joins the Opportunities, Field Data, Lab Data, and Diagnostics metrics of the PageSpeed Insights tool.

 **B) Accessibility**

 The first of the new regions of Google Lighthouse is the Accessibility metric.

 Basically what this metric does is feature potential chances to improve the availability and client experience of your mobile app or website.

 Following the accessibility improvement report will guarantee that your clients can without much of a stretch explore and utilize your site.

 **C) Best Practices**

 Another segment new to Google's analysis tools is the Best Practices metric.

 This region of the Lighthouse report doesn't carefully give execution related data.

 However, it will give you recommendations which can improve both your exhibition and client experience, particularly for mobile sites.

   **D) Progressive Web Applications**

  The Progressive Web App area is another of Google's most up to date execution measurements incorporated into its Lighthouse tool.

 While the meaning of a Progressive Web App (PWA) hasn't been especially clear, Google's documentation expresses that there are a few key variables which make a site a PWA:

 - Each page has a start URL
 - Metadata given to Add to Home screen
 - First load quick even on 3G
 - Pages are responsive on tablets and cell phones
 - Page advances don't feel like they produce lag on the network
 - All application URLs load while disconnected
 - Site works cross-browser
 - Site is served over HTTPS
